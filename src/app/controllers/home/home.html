    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>
      The achievement I am proudest of is certainly the speed I grew in my past job. I soon became of the Senior developers and started leading teams (one at a time) with very different backgrounds. Don't take me wrong: I love coding (check out my github), but I am passionate about leading and connecting. Today, my boldness and confidence on my capabilities/ethics are my main strengths. I am not afraid of starting on a very initial level at an ambitious company (if I think they have a good service), because I am confident that I will grow my career there (respecting hierarchy and being truthful to my colleagues). As soon as I finished my 3-year contract I went back to Germany to find my next professional challenge.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have a bachelor in Computer Science, I joined research projects in Brazil and Germany and I read books on innovation, leadership and biographies on IT personalities (such as Alan Turing, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates), so I am looking for a work I can be proud of. I don't want to merely build software, I want to invent the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      My profile is aligned to 3 main categories (in order of preference): Data Science, Backend/API and Frontend. I am passionate about two technologies and have wide experience with them: Python (for Data Science and Backend) and SQL/NoSQL, but I worked with many, many others (e.g, Java, R, ASP.Net, so forth) and I am always excited to learn new frameworks/technologies.

      Prefered industries: IT, Financial and Environmental.
