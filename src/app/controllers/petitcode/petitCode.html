      I was contracted as the house's Python and Angular Developer, but in my job at PetitCode I love to help less experienced engineers to build and manage their solution on AWS (e.g, <a href="https://app.findsomebuddy.de/reactapp/" target="_blank">Alex's FindSomebuddy</a>) and with any questions on git, GitLab, GitHub Pages, Jenkins, etc. Technologies: NGINX and Apache, Linux, Django.
