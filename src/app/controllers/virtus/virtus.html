      Virtus is a project-based Brazilian company almost reaching the 200 employees mark.
      We are proudly delivering products to big IT companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I worked in two very different projects/realities: Asus Brazil (2 years) and HP US/Brazil (1 year), so I have
      the experience to talk to big contributors to the world's IT development (such as John Landry and Cael Filho).

      My first project was pure web development, but the services provided on the RESTful API side of the product was
      also consumed by ASUS games and apps created in Brazil. Technologies: Django/Python & AngularJs, NGINX, Linux, SQL, git, Jenkins, Tuleap.
    </p>
    <p>
      My second project was a data science focused project and I was responsible for the data analysis/visualization
      team which also created a web tool, but was focused in technologies such as:
      R, Spark, Python & NoSQL, Tableau and Databricks.
