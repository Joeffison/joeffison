    <h1>Literature</h1>
    <p>
      Reading is my other true passion.
      I have books on three categories: History of IT, Science and Arts and biographies of people in these fields (Alan Turing's biography by his mother Sara Turing; "Steve Jobs" by Walter Isaacson; etc.); Finances, Leadership and Building/Directing a Company ("Creativity, Inc." by Edwin Catmull, president of Pixar); Classics of Literature and Poetry (Oscar Wilde's work, Clarice Lispector, etc); and novels by new contemporary writers (such as "Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe" novel by Benjamin Alire Sáenz; "O Punho Fechado no Fio da Navalha" poetry book by Patricia Naia).

      <h2>Oscar Wilde</h2>
      <p>
        I am a <b>HUGE</b> fan of Oscar Wilde and his novel "The Picture of Dorian Gray" is certainly my favorite book since 2010. I watched many movies based on his works and life. I have a total of 14 books on my collection of Oscar Wilde: 8 different editions of "The Picture of Dorian Gray" (one of them also includes many of his plays and tales:
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Picture-Dorian-Gray-Other-Works/dp/1435139437/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1523480945&sr=1-1&keywords=9781435139435">ISBN 9781435139435</a>); 2 editions with "De Profundis" and "The Ballad of Reading Gaol"; 2 books of Epigrams; 1 edition of "The ghost of the canterville" (it is also included on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Picture-Dorian-Gray-Other-Works/dp/1435139437/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1523480945&sr=1-1&keywords=9781435139435">ISBN 9781435139435</a>); and 1 edition of "Teleny or The Reverse of the Medal" (which is attributed to him and, despite of all controversy, I strongly believe it is his).
