      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lsd.ufcg.edu.br/#/">LSD</a> (Distributed Systems Laboratory) is a lab where UFCG researchers collaborate on Distributed Systems Engineering projects. It was here that
      <a target="_blank" href="http://ourgrid.lsd.ufcg.edu.br/overview.php">OurGrid</a> was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      My project was on Smart Grids and my supervisor was Dr.-Ing. Andrey Elísio Monteiro Brito (graduated at Technische Universität Dresden). He introduced me to Distributed Systems, working on cloud services and the concept of Smart Grids. We built an open source tool to create simulated data for our research, which was continued on the project at TU Dresden.
